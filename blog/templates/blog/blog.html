		Blogs provide an efficient way to learn new things. Writing a blog involves reading and assessing other resources available on the internet and applying the knowledge which you have recently acquired. Writing Blogs is beneficial for people as they are first getting the knowledge and is also a help for others who had a curiosity about the same topic on which the blog is written. Writing blogs is a good exercise to keep yourself updated and thus I prefer writing a blog or an article every time I found some topic interesting or worth sharing.
