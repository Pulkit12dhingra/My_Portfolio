		Every time we do an online course or get some knowledge the instructor says <b>"get your hands dirty over the code"</b>. Creating a project is often referred to as best practice to understand the basics and get used to the code. Working on a project is a journey of resolving errors and understanding them to get an idea of what is to be done and how is to be done. A complete working project boosts the confidence level and increases the curiosity to hunt for more. I always try to work on at least a single project on each skill I learn to test my knowledge and gain more intuition on the topic as well as errors. Here is a list of a few of my end-to-end developed projects. Though there are more fun stuff on my <a href="https://github.com/Pulkit12dhingra" target="_blank">github</a>.
