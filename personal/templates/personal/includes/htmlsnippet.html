	Firstly, let me introduce myself to you.
	I am <b>Pulkit Dhingra</b>. A <b>Computer Science</b> Engineering student from <b>Babu Banarsi Das Northern 
	India Institute Of Technology, Lucknow</b>. I am currently in the sixth semester of my curriculum. Being the field of computer science I had exercised a bit with many programming languages and out of all of them <b>Python</b> is the one that caught my eye the most. This lead to my introduction to the field of <b>Machine Learning and Data Science</b>. My interest grew as I studied in-depth about the topics, and eventually my excitement and hunger to learn more. I also learned <b> R programming language</b> and also gained knowledge about <b> Tableau, Apache Spark(pyspark) and SAS Programming</b>. I did work on projects to strengthen my knowledge, for which you can visit my <a href="https://github.com/Pulkit12dhingra">Github account</a> to have a peek at them. Data Analytics and Data Science is a rapidly growing field that keeps me moving in the hunt for cool new tech and tools, and I want to build my career in the field. <b>Currently, I am open to all the opportunities in the field of Data Analytics and Data Science<b>.

<h3>Internship Experience</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
	Internships are one of the best mediums to learn. I had done several internships to boost my strength and get my knowledge at par with the industry-level implementation. I had listed all my internships below:-
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Data Scientist Intern at Ardberry Tech. Prvt. Ltd.</h4>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			The internship was at the Research and Development department of Ardberry Technologies Private Limited. The company is architectural-based and I worked on a project related to security and penetration. The project was titled 'Sign to Unlock' and it was about hand detection and tracking to make a pattern affiliated to the user who is registered. It had modern-day technologies like face detection included but it was more likely a cool way of doing the regular thing. The internship provided me a gateway to understanding new things and how an actual project is developed in the industry.

		<li><h4>Technical Writer for Geeks For Geeks</h4>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			Geeks For Geeks is a renowned computer science portal, consisting of a lot of stuff from articles to programming questions, interview experiences, and more. In the internship, I contribute multiple articles on Python and R programming languages. I had also contributed articles on Machine Learning and Apache Spark's pyspark. Writing an article increment our knowledge as we read similar articles on the topic to write up our own. It was an interesting internship as I learned multiple tricks and techniques that will make programming a lot easier.  
		</p></li>
		<li><h4>Data Science Intern at GRIP Sparks Foundation</h4>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			The internship was a part of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program from the Sparks Foundation. It was my first internship. I worked on a decision tree model on the iris dataset classification model. I also worked on business data analytics project working on superstore data finding answers to many business-oriented questions using data analytics with python.

		</ul>
<h3>Volunteership Experience</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
		I was a mentor at <b>AI for Youth Mentorship program</b>. It was in an internship offered by the Shashwat foundation. AI for Youth Mentorship Program is an initiative from the Government of India in collaboration with Intel India to encourage youth, students from government schools towards Machine Learning and AI. As a mentor, I supervised and helped students to build on their project ideas, which they had submitted earlier at the beginning of the program. There were four students under my mentorship lead. It was an interesting and new experience for me to guide students from different parts of the country and share my knowledge with them. By taking part as a mentor I also strengthened my knowledge of data science. I created projects on the ideas and showed the students under my lead a path to create the project on their own.
