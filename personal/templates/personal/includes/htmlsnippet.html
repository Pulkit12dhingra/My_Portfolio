	Hi!!. I am <b>Pulkit Dhingra</b>. A <b>Computer Science</b> Engineering student from <b>Babu Banarsi Das Northern India Institute Of Technology, Lucknow</b>. I am currently in the eighth semester of my curriculum. Being in the field of computer science, I had exercised with many programming languages, out of which <b>Python</b> is the one that caught my eye the most. This lead to my introduction to the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. As I studied in-depth about the topics, my interest grew, and eventually, my excitement to learn more in the domain. I also learned the <b>R programming language</b> and acquired knowledge about <b>Tableau, Apache Spark(pyspark), and SAS Programming</b>. I did work on projects to strengthen my knowledge base, for which you can visit my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click here to view the profile" href="https://github.com/Pulkit12dhingra" target="_blank">Github account</a> to have a peek. Data Analytics and Data Science is a rapidly growing field that keeps me moving in the hunt for cool new tech and tools, and I want to build my career in the domain. <b>Currently, I am open to all the opportunities in the field of Data Analytics and Data Science</b>.

<h3>Internship Experience</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
	Internships are one of the best mediums to learn. I had done several internships to boost my strength and get my knowledge at par with the industry-level implementation. I had listed all my internships below:-
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Data Scientist Intern at Ardberry Tech. Prvt. Ltd.</h4>
			<pre>10/2020 - 01/2021</pre>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			The internship was at the Research and Development department of Ardberry Technologies Private Limited. It is an architectural-based company, and I worked on a project related to security and penetration. The project was about hand detection and tracking to make a pattern affiliated with the registered user. It has features of modern-day technologies like face detection included, but it was more likely a fun way of doing the regular thing. The internship provided me a gateway to understanding new things and how an actual project develops in the industry.

		<li><h4>Technical Writer for Geeks For Geeks</h4>
			<pre>04/2021 - 06/2021</pre>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			Geeks For Geeks is a renowned computer science portal consisting of stuff from articles to programming questions, interview experiences, and more. In the internship, I contribute multiple articles on Python and R programming languages. I had also contributed articles on Machine Learning and Apache Spark's pyspark. Writing an article increment our knowledge as we read similar articles on the topic to write up our own. It was an exciting internship as I learned multiple tricks and techniques that will come in handy for programming.

		<li><h4>Data Science Intern at GRIP Sparks Foundation</h4>
			<pre>09/2020 - 10/2020</pre>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
			The internship was a part of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program from the Sparks Foundation. It was my gateway to the professional world. It was more about how things are done rather than what is to be done. I worked on a decision tree model on the iris dataset classification model. I also worked on business data analytics project working on superstore data finding answers to many business-oriented questions using data analytics with python.

		</ul>
<h3>Volunteership Experience</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:500">
		An internship offered by the Shashwat Foundation was a volunteering mentorship opportunity in the <b>AI for Youth Mentorship Program</b>. The initiative is from the Government of India in collaboration with Intel India to encourage youth, students from government schools towards Machine Learning and AI. As a mentor, I supervised and helped students build on their project ideas, which they had submitted earlier at the beginning of the program. There were four students under my mentorship lead. It was an exciting and new experience for me to guide students from different parts of the country and share my knowledge with others. By mentoring, I also strengthened my knowledge base of data science. I worked on projects and showed the students under my lead a path to build on their ideas.
